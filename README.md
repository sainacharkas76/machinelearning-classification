# Machinelearning data classification project
## Project description
The Research & Development team of Tyre Inc. has been testing a number of new products for potential introduction to the market. For each tyre, a number of attributes have been collected about the tyre characteristics and the testing conditions, as well as the outcome of the test, i.e., success or failure. 

A machine learning model for predicting tire failures should be developed.
